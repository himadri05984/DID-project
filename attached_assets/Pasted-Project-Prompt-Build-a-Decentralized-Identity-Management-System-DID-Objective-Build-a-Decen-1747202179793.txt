Project Prompt: Build a Decentralized Identity Management System (DID)
üß† Objective:
Build a Decentralized Identity Management application that empowers users to create, manage, and verify their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. Use Python, blockchain integration, and cryptographic protocols to provide a secure, privacy-respecting system.

üõ† Features & Tasks:
‚úÖ Core Functionality
User Wallet System:

Create and manage W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

Store cryptographic key pairs and link them to DIDs.

Verifiable Credentials (VCs):

Issue, store, and verify credentials (e.g., ‚ÄúUniversity Student‚Äù).

Implement selective disclosure for privacy.

Blockchain Integration:

Use Ethereum (via Web3.py) or Hyperledger Indy to anchor identity proofs.

Store cryptographic hashes or verifiable credential data on-chain (not full PII!).

Authentication & Authorization:

Build login and data-sharing flows using zero-knowledge proofs or similar mechanisms.

Add credential revocation functionality.

User Interface (UI):

Web interface using Flask (or optionally desktop app with PyQt/Tkinter).

Show wallet info, credentials, and sharing history.

Security Testing & Documentation:

Add unit tests with Pytest.

Perform static analysis using Bandit.

Write a simple deployment + user guide (README.md).
